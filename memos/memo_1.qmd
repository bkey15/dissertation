## Introduction

### Purpose

Since defending my prospectus, I've developed, deployed, and refined a raft of models that carry out my express research agenda. The object of this memo is to describe these models and both illustrate and comment on my central findings.

### Research Questions

Before proceeding, it may be useful to recall the contents of my research agenda. To this end, below are concise formulations of the questions animating each chapter (in order):

1. Do human rights conditions in preferential trade agreements (PTAs), particularly when codified as more legalized (i.e., "harder"), improve human rights respect among signatories?
2. Do bilateral investment treaties (BITs) improve human rights respect among signatories?
3. Do economic sanctions sent by Western states improve human rights respect among non-Western targets?

### Key Findings

As we shall see in the remainder of the memo, my models (as presently construed) suggest the following general answers to my research questions: 

1. "Harder" human rights conditions in PTAs are associated with improved human rights respect in less-democratic states but a worsening of such respect in more-democratic ones.
2. Likewise, BITs are associated with improved human rights respect in less-democratic states but a worsening of such respect in more-democratic ones.
3. Conversely, economic sanctions against non-Western states are associated with worsened human rights respect in less-democratic targets but an improvement of such respect in more-democratic ones.

### Overview of Memo

The remainder of my memo is organized as follows:

1.  A description of my general methods for the dissertation writ large (@sec-gen-mtd).
2.  Discussions and illustrations of my work and findings for each chapter (@sec-ch1, @sec-ch2, @sec-ch3).
3.  A conclusion, wherein I contemplate remaining questions and future work (@sec-cncl).
4.  Appendices (@sec-appx).

## The General Methodology {#sec-gen-mtd}

### Replication

In each chapter, I first run models that approximately replicate those of the literature inspiring my work, the main points of departure (where appropriate) being (1.) the substitution of [HR Scores](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/HumanRightsScores) for the authors' outcomes and my selected treatments for theirs, and (2.) the use of both unimputed (in line with the authors' methodologies) and multiply-imputed data. I do so to test whether the introduction of new key variables and/or multiple imputation immediately yields divergent results. More on these replications can be found in @sec-ch1-rep, @sec-ch2-rep, and @sec-ch3-rep.

### Preprocessing

#### Data Wrangling

Before running the replication and novel models, I assemble a dataset, $\textbf{X}$, through data wrangling. The first (and perhaps most involved) step in this process is the creation of the treatment variables, a task which generally demands significant transformations to the raw data to ultimately render them in panel (i.e., country-year) format. How these treatments are sourced and generated is discussed further in @sec-ch1-treats, @sec-ch2-treats, and @sec-ch3-treats.

Secondly, I consolidate the outcome (HR Scores) and covariates, and I create additional covariates where necessary. Common to all three chapters are the following covariates:

1.  All [V-Dem](https://www.v-dem.net/) high-level and mid-level indices.
2.  [Polity Score](https://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html).
3.  World Development Indicators (World Bank) pertaining to:^[These variables are proximately sourced from the [Quality of Governance](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data) (QoG) dataset.]
  i. Trade (sum of exports and imports of goods and services, % of GDP).
  ii. Foreign direct investment (net inflows and outflows, % of GDP).
  iii. Population density.
4.  Regime durability.^[This variable is also sourced from the QoG dataset.]
5.  Latent estimates of GDP, GDPpc, and population (logged).
6.  Balance of payments (% of GDP).

Decisions about outlier countries (which ones are included, which ones aren't, how some are coded).

#### Multiple Imputation

From here, remaining missingness in the covariates of $\textbf{X}$ are handled through multiple imputation.
