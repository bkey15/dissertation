-When should newly-independent countries enter the dataset?
-When should the models begin?

-COW coding rules for former countries:
  -260 -> 255 (Germany)
  -315 -> 316 (Czech Rep.)
  -678 -> 679 (Yemen)
  -Yugoslavia -> Serbia (345)

-HRAs values pre-1968, right now, is NA (this is year where first HRA is ratified). Should these values be NA or 0?

#11/30/24#

-In Hafner-Burton (2005, p. 615), check note 87. Doesn't seem to be a way of telling how the autocorrelative "binary indicators" were computed.
-Add HRAs var to imputation models.

-The partially linear regression model (PLR), when lasso is used at steps 1 & 2, corresponds to the double lasso proposed in Belloni et al. (2014). See https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/guide/models.html.
-Not using `use_other_treat_as_covariate = FALSE` (default is TRUE) in `double_ml_data_from_data_frame()`. Am assuming treatment 1 (e.g., cpr_mean) is correlated with treatment 2 (esr_mean), which probably bears out in the data.

-Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA):
  -Hafner-Burton (2005) gives this as an example of a soft PTA. But is it?
  -She gives Article 6 (Fundamental Principles) as the key soft provision. This appears in Chapter 3: Aims and Objectives.
  -Chapter 4 (Organs of the Common Market) enumerates entities charged with ensuring that objectives/aims of COMESA are being met (e.g., the secretary general).
  -Chapter 5 (The Court of Justice) describes how the foregeoing entities can bring charges of treaty violations for review, and how Court judgments are binding, in that "[a] Member State or the Council shall take, without delay, the measures required to implement a judgment of the Court" (Article 34).
  -Article 50 allows member states to "introduce or continue or execute restrictions or prohibitions affecting," inter alia, "arms" and "the protection of human [...] life."
  -Chapter 31 discusses sanctions, which may be imposed when a member state "defaults in performing an obligation under this Treaty" or "whose conduct [...] is prejudicial to the existence or the attainment of the objectives of the Common Market." Violations of Article 6 seem sanctionable.
  -Perhaps this may be seen as a "harder" (if not "hardest") PTA.
  -Also: the International Justice Resource Center (IJRC) gives the COMESA Court of Justice as an example of a court/tribunal with "competence to decide individual complaints arising under domestic or community law, which may involve fundamental rights." See https://ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/.
  
-Cotonou Agreement:
  -Hafner-Burton (2005) gives this as an example of a hard PTA. It is definitely "harder," and this is reflected in the higher Lechner scores.
-United States Vietnam:
  -Perhaps a PTA to mention in discussing something that doesn't mention NTIs (i.e., not at all "hard").
  
-Mexico - EC Cooperation Agreement:
  -Mentions commitments to democracy and human rights in the preamble and Article 1. Article 3 calls for nebulous "political dialogue" on the basis of Article 1 principles and to cover "all [...] matters of mutual interest." The "enforcement mechanism" outlined in Part IV is very weak.
  -Perhaps a good example of a PTA that is in fact "soft."

#12/12/24#

-Based on yesterday's observations, will be testing a new theory re: incentives to improve human rights respect:
  -South-South PTAs: none (see COMESA; defection likely)
  -North-North PTAS: none (shadow of futue a la Spilker & BÃ¶hmelt)
  -North-South PTAS: none (ibid.)
  -South-North PTAS: present (latter has leverage over former)
-This could obviously be a 2x2 table.
-Also think about the Helsinki Final Act as an example of an agreement that human rights disrespectors signed on to.

-See the STADL article (p. 60, footnote 6) for a discussion of why a first-order time lag (L1) should probably suffice.
-Also in the STADL article (p. 63): spatial autocorrelation (SAR) models need instrumental variables or systems maximum likelihood.
-Not including a lagged dependent variable (LDV) for now (i.e., hr_score_l1 as a regressor) because it's leading to overfitting (put differently, it's sucking up all of the statistical significance). And, in any case, a lot of the other covariates reasonably predict future human rights respect. For further evidence, see autocorrelation plot in EDA script.

-IJRC gives the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice as an example of a PTA-founded court/tribunal with clear jurisdiction over human rights issues (supported with case law). See https://ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/economic-community-of-west-african-states-court-of-justice/
