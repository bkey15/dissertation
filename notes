-When should newly-independent countries enter the dataset?
-When should the models begin?

-COW coding rules for former countries:
  -260 -> 255 (Germany)
  -315 -> 316 (Czech Rep.)
  -678 -> 679 (Yemen)
  -Yugoslavia -> Serbia (345)

-HRAs values pre-1968, right now, is NA (this is year where first HRA is ratified). Should these values be NA or 0?

-In Hafner-Burton (2005, p. 615), check note 87. Doesn't seem to be a way of telling how the autocorrelative "binary indicators" were computed.
-Add HRAs var to imputation models.

-The partially linear regression model (PLR), when lasso is used at steps 1 & 2, corresponds to the double lasso proposed in Belloni et al. (2014). See https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/guide/models.html.
-Not using `use_other_treat_as_covariate = FALSE` (default is TRUE) in `double_ml_data_from_data_frame()`. Am assuming treatment 1 (e.g., cpr_mean) is correlated with treatment 2 (esr_mean), which probably bears out in the data.
