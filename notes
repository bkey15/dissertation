-When should newly-independent countries enter the dataset?
-When should the models begin?

#11/26/24#

-COW coding rules for former countries:
  -260 -> 255 (Germany)
  -315 -> 316 (Czech Rep.)
  -678 -> 679 (Yemen)
  -Yugoslavia -> Serbia (345)
  
#11/27/24#

-HRAs values pre-1968, right now, is NA (this is year where first HRA is ratified). Should these values be NA or 0?

#11/30/24#

-In Hafner-Burton (2005, p. 615), check note 87. Doesn't seem to be a way of telling how the autocorrelative "binary indicators" were computed.
-Add HRAs var to imputation models.

#12/4/24#

-The partially linear regression model (PLR), when lasso is used at steps 1 & 2, corresponds to the double lasso proposed in Belloni et al. (2014). See https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/guide/models.html.
-Not using `use_other_treat_as_covariate = FALSE` (default is TRUE) in `double_ml_data_from_data_frame()`. Am assuming treatment 1 (e.g., cpr_mean) is correlated with treatment 2 (esr_mean), which probably bears out in the data.

-For PTA text, see https://edit.wti.org/document/investment-treaty/search

-Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA):
  -Hafner-Burton (2005) gives this as an example of a soft PTA. But is it?
  -She gives Article 6 (Fundamental Principles) as the key soft provision. This appears in Chapter 3: Aims and Objectives.
  -Chapter 4 (Organs of the Common Market) enumerates entities charged with ensuring that objectives/aims of COMESA are being met (e.g., the secretary general).
  -Chapter 5 (The Court of Justice) describes how the foregeoing entities can bring charges of treaty violations for review, and how Court judgments are binding, in that "[a] Member State or the Council shall take, without delay, the measures required to implement a judgment of the Court" (Article 34).
  -Article 50 allows member states to "introduce or continue or execute restrictions or prohibitions affecting," inter alia, "arms" and "the protection of human [...] life."
  -Chapter 31 discusses sanctions, which may be imposed when a member state "defaults in performing an obligation under this Treaty" or "whose conduct [...] is prejudicial to the existence or the attainment of the objectives of the Common Market." Violations of Article 6 seem sanctionable.
  -Perhaps this may be seen as a "harder" (if not "hardest") PTA.
  -Also: the International Justice Resource Center (IJRC) gives the COMESA Court of Justice as an example of a court/tribunal with "competence to decide individual complaints arising under domestic or community law, which may involve fundamental rights." See https://ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/.
  
-Cotonou Agreement:
  -Hafner-Burton (2005) gives this as an example of a hard PTA. It is definitely "harder," and this is reflected in the higher Lechner scores.
-United States Vietnam:
  -Perhaps a PTA to mention in discussing something that doesn't mention NTIs (i.e., not at all "hard").
  
-Mexico - EC Cooperation Agreement:
  -Mentions commitments to democracy and human rights in the preamble and Article 1. Article 3 calls for nebulous "political dialogue" on the basis of Article 1 principles and to cover "all [...] matters of mutual interest." The "enforcement mechanism" outlined in Part IV is very weak.
  -Perhaps a good example of a PTA that is in fact "soft."

#12/12/24#

-Based on yesterday's observations, will be testing a new theory re: incentives to improve human rights respect:
  -South-South PTAs: none (see COMESA; defection likely)
  -North-North PTAS: none (shadow of futue a la Spilker & BÃ¶hmelt)
  -North-South PTAS: none (ibid.)
  -South-North PTAS: present (latter has leverage over former)
-This could obviously be a 2x2 table.
-Also think about the Helsinki Final Act as an example of an agreement that human rights disrespectors signed on to.

#12/13/24#

-See the STADL article (p. 60, footnote 6) for a discussion of why a first-order time lag (L1) should probably suffice.
-Also in the STADL article (p. 63): spatial autocorrelation (SAR) models need instrumental variables or systems maximum likelihood.
-Not including a lagged dependent variable (LDV) for now (i.e., hr_score_l1 as a regressor) because it's leading to overfitting (put differently, it's sucking up all of the statistical significance). And, in any case, a lot of the other covariates reasonably predict future human rights respect. For further evidence, see autocorrelation plot in EDA script.

-IJRC gives the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice as an example of a PTA-founded court/tribunal with clear jurisdiction over human rights issues (supported with case law). See https://ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/economic-community-of-west-african-states-court-of-justice/

-In light of results, perhaps 2x2 table could be framed in terms of "likehihood" of harder HR conditions improving HR respect. Maybe SS is "low", NS & NN are "medium," and SN is "high"?
-2x2 draft: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1XDVoTLSHDuMfO1plwrx0aUjp3bDxBAvMbghNC58WMr8/edit

#12/15/24#

-After new imputation process, only true missing values come from a few former/partially recognized countries (Kosovo, Taiwan, S. Yemen, S. Vietnam). Of these, only Kosovo & Taiwan signed PTAs.
-In mice::pool.table(), dfcom = Inf. According to help file, this can be safely assumed when n > 1000. My smallest dataset (North states, 1977+) is about 1400 observations (once Taiwan, which has missing wdi values, is removed), so the assumption is met.

#12/16/24#

-The foregoing 4 countries can't be removed post-imputation (i.e., at the lag step) because doing so creates unequal .imp group sizes, which throws an error during as.mids(). Just note that these rows (n = 91 for 1968) are effectively removed in the regressions that follow.

# 2/25/25 #
-Description of BIT-scraping process:
  1. "Inspect" HTML code from UNCTAD's "International Investment Agreements Navigator": https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/international-investment-agreements
  2. W/n the inspect element, select the "Network" tab. Scroll down the webpage to "fetch" a new page from the data table (`recent-treaties`).
  3. Right-click the fetch and copy as "cURL". Paste this code into the following cURL converter: https://curlconverter.com/r-httr2/
  4. Copy the translated code and paste in R. Follow the scrape script file from here.
-This process was necessary because the data table was interactive, and could only be accessed in full one "page" at a time. An `RSelenium` workflow might've helped automate some of this, but I struggled to establish a connection with the server.
-The total number of pages (157 on 2/25/25) was found through trial and error.

# 4/21/25 #
-BITs controls:
  -Not including HRAs or hard/soft PTA indicators for reasons outlined in prospectus (no clear relationship with treatment).
  -Not including interstate or civil war in view of 1) unclear relationships with the treatment, and 2) lack of quality data.
  -Using V-Dem's pro-democracy mobilization variable in lieu of political dissent, for reason's outlined in my Social Movements research paper.
  -For now, I will include (unlike Bodea & Ye) FDI outflows in addition to inflows.

-For the PTAs chapter, I realized I didn't use the "absolute values" of FDI outflows and inflows in computing the investment variable. This issue only affected about 10% of the observations, but I'm running everything again nonetheless.

# 5/6/25 #
-All DML fits feature cluster-robust SEs. See https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/examples/R_double_ml_multiway_cluster.html.
-glmnet::cv.glmnet() (called for in DoubleMLPLR$new(ml_* = lrn())) chooses its own lambda sequences and picks the lambda with the smallest cross-validation error (s = "lambda.min"). Sequence (lambda) & smallest lambda (lambda.min) for each regression (outcome as final outcome or treatment, respectively), and from each repetition-fold, can be found in the "models" tab of the fit object.

# 5/9/25 #
-For Ch. 2, truest Bodea-Ye replications (scripts 3(a)) yield same results as their paper (negative & significant coefficient on n_ptas, positive and significant coefficient on e_polity2*n_ptas).
-Results begin to vary once imputations are used.
-"Logged event" after as.mids() in north/south models is glb_s (is constant after filtering to glb_s == 1 or glb_s == 0). Not an issue, because the variable isn't included in the model.

# 5/13/25 #
-Seek out information on how to handle multicollinearity for inferential lasso models. May be less important given use of double ML (de-biasing) approach. Can turn to tidymodels recipes if needed.
-We know fits are using the lasso model because in lrn("regr.cv_glmnet"), the default elastic-net mixing parameter is: alpha = 1. (1 for lasso, 0 for ridge.) See https://mlr3learners.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_learners_regr.cv_glmnet.html. Also see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/glmnet.pdf.

# 5/14/25 #
-From double_ml_data_from_data_frame help file (function used to complete data backend initialization): use_other_treat_as_covariate = TRUE
-In fit step, "parallel = TRUE" argument is a cv.glmnet parameter recognized by lrn(). See https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/glmnet/versions/4.1-8/topics/cv.glmnet and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr3learners/mlr3learners.pdf.
-Viewing lambda sequence tested and the minimum lambda selected for each learner requires models to be saved in fit step (within lrn() function). If saved (will yield very large files), access via: imp fit # --> models --> learner (ml_l or ml_m) --> treatment name --> repetition # --> fold # --> model --> $lambda (sequence) or $lambda.min (selected)
-Note that the length of the lambda sequence is fairly large (~ 80; varies by fold).
